<!-- The idea is to write some JS that will allow a fully customiseable dashboard to be built from weblinks and iframes -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
  <title> URVU dashboard </title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles">
</head>
<body>
<!-- this div will be hideable and revealable also toggleable options will be added here-->
    <div class = 'buttons'>
        <input placeholder = "name your panel">
        <input placeholder = "input the link to what you want shown">
        <button> Add a view to URVU</button>
        <input placeholder = "name your dashboard page">
        <button> Add a new page to URVU </button>
    </div>



    <div class = "dash" id = "dash1">
<div id = "charity window">
    Like URVU? support a charity to show your appreciation.
</div>
    </div>

    



<!-- script added here will ruin the page, should be entirely dynamic and rely on local storage of the HTML to save views-->
<script>
// hide show function for controls


//drag and drop feature


// full screen toggle

// generate new view function


//generate new page function


// generate tabs (for multiple pages)

</script>    
</body>

</html>
